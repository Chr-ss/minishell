# Contributing to minishell

Usually this document in a real project would be used to document developers can contribute from outside the project to with their contributions. Since this is a school project where there are only us two students working on the project we will use this document to describe our collaboration process that we have decided to implement for this project.


## branches

We have decided to implement branches in order to protect the main branch. We have decided to change the settings of the repository so we have only one merge master.
